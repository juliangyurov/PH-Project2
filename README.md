**Description:** Make a game using `UIKit`, and learn about integers, buttons, colors and actions.

- Setting up

- Designing your layout

- Making the basic game work: `UIButton` and `CGLayer`

- Guess which flag: random numbers

- From outlets to actions: creating an `IBAction`

- Wrap up

**Challenge**

1. Try showing the player’s score in the navigation bar, alongside the flag to guess.

2. Keep track of how many questions have been asked, and show one final alert controller after they have answered 10 times. This should show their final score.
   
3. When someone chooses the wrong flag, tell them their mistake in your alert message – something like “Wrong! That’s the flag of France”, for example.
